/**
 * Best Practice: Connect to the database before starting the server
 * This ensures that the server only starts if the database connection is successful
 * If the database connection fails, we can log the error and exit the process
 * This prevents the server from running in an inconsistent state where it cannot access the database.
 * This is especially important for applications that rely on database operations for their functionality.
 * It helps in maintaining the integrity and reliability of the application.
 * This is a common pattern in Node.js applications to ensure that the server is ready to handle
